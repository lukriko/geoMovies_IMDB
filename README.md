# geoMovies_IMDB


which georgian movies are best by IMDB rating?

After asking myself that question i started to dive into movies dataset and do EDA on it.

First of all i scrapped the dataset using instant data scrapper and imported as csv file.
After which the main part was cleaning especially the null and blank values.

After all the cleaning done, with help of AI, generated problems were left to be answered and solved.


I have explored several important features from sql like:

•	calculate average rating per year per movie
•	calculate average rating per year
•	average percentage change per year
•	comparing avg rating of 20th century and 21st century
•	A rating greater than the global average plus its standard deviation.
	Belong to an air date group with more than 2 movies.


after main points established i have made correlations between several important headers of dataset.



Python:

•	Trend of average ratings and votes over years 
•	Playtime and rating correlation(wether playtime plays a huge role in rating formation)
•	Rating and vote correlation ( does higher votes mean higher ratings?)
•	Lastly: I anayzed top 20% and bottom 80% by runtime and playtime
